# 🐍 Snake Game - Retro Arcade Edition 🎮

This is a retro-inspired version of the classic Snake game, built using Python and the Pygame library. The game features dynamic snake movement, food mechanics, and a classic arcade soundtrack that plays throughout the game. The game includes:

- **Gridlines** to help navigate the snake and track progress more easily.
- **Snake Mechanics**: The snake grows longer with each piece of food consumed, and the game ends when the snake collides with itself.
- **Game Over Screen**: When the snake dies, a "Game Over" message appears, and the music pauses until you press any key to restart.
